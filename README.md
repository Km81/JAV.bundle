[ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆReadme](README.zh.md)

**JAV.bundle** is a [plex](https://plex.tv) agent for Japanese porn videos. It collects data from [JavLibrary](https://javlibrary.com/), [AVEntertainments](https://www.aventertainments.com/) and some studio's official sites.

This agent currently only supports crawl Japanese contents, you can create a pull request to help us to support other languages.

## Installation
Download the latest source zip from [repository](https://github.com/Xavier-Lam/JAV.bundle), then unzip the zip file to the [Plex plugin folder](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201106098-How-do-I-find-the-Plug-Ins-folder-). You can follow [this guide](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201187656-how-do-i-manually-install-a-plugin/) to install JAV.bundle.



## Usage
After the plugin has been installed, you can select `JAV` as your library's agent in your library's edit page, and you should use `Plex Movie Scanner` as the library's scanner.

For users live in mainland of PR China, please make sure you have abilities to access the sites which the agent crawls data from, these sites may be blocked in your country.


### Configuration
There are two settings for JAV.bundle agent. Whether to use [cloudscraper](https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper) library to scraper data and what user-agent string to use when sending requests.

I couldn't figure out why sometimes [cloudscraper](https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper) may meet an unexpected protection page, these settings may be useful when cloudscraper does not work properly.



## Guide
### Name and organize your videos
For censored videos, the video's name or its parent folder's name must contain the video id, using space or square bracket to split the id from other parts of title like these:

* JBD-226
* [JBD-226]No Torture Remaining 4 Shinoda Yu
* JBD-226 No Torture Remaining 4 Shinoda Yu

For the uncensored videos being crawled from their official site(including [caribbeancom](https://caribbeancom.com), [1pondo](https://1pondo.tv), [heyzo](https://heyzo.com) and [tokyo-hot](https://tokyo-hot.com)), I recommend to name your video or ancent folder by including both studio's name and the video's id:

* 1Pondo 052611_102 Nozomi Hazuki
* Caribbean 111914-739 Facial For Mature 8 Part 1 Ryu Enami
* Heyzo 0796 Hamar's World 20 -Secrets about Miyuki- - Miyuki Ojima

For other uncensored videos whose data is collected from [AVEntertainments](https://aventertainments.com), You should name your video like this:

* [RED-052] Red Hot Fetish Collection Vol. 37 : Kiriya Anno
* [SKY-101] Sky Angel Vol.63 Sayaka Fukuhara


### Manually identify your video
Sometimes you may not get the correct match result for your video, especially for those who are collected by using AVEntertainments agent, whose match strategy is not very good. You can try to type the id of your video in the title field to correct the match result.
