You can follow [this guide](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201187656-how-do-i-manually-install-a-plugin/) to install JAV.bundle.



## Usage
After the plugin has been installed, you can select `JAV` as your library's agent in your library's edit page, and you should use `Plex Movie Scanner` as the library's scanner.

For users live in mainland of PR China, please make sure you have abilities to access the sites which the agent crawls data from, these sites may be blocked in your country.


## Guide
### Name and organize your videos
For censored videos, the video's name or its parent folder's name must contain the video id, using space or square bracket to split the id from other parts of title like these:

* JBD-226
* [JBD-226]No Torture Remaining 4 Shinoda Yu
* JBD-226 No Torture Remaining 4 Shinoda Yu

For the uncensored videos being crawled from their official site(including [caribbeancom](https://caribbeancom.com), [1pondo](https://1pondo.tv), [heyzo](https://heyzo.com) and [tokyo-hot](https://tokyo-hot.com)), I recommend to name your video or parent folder by including both studio's name and the video's id:

* 1Pondo 052611_102 Nozomi Hazuki
* Caribbean 111914-739 Facial For Mature 8 Part 1 Ryu Enami
* Heyzo 0796 Hamar's World 20 -Secrets about Miyuki- - Miyuki Ojima

For other uncensored videos whose data is collected from [AVEntertainments](https://aventertainments.com), You should name your video like this:

* [RED-052] Red Hot Fetish Collection Vol.37 : Kiriya Anno
* [SKY-101] Sky Angel Vol.63 Sayaka Fukuhara


### Manually identify your video
Sometimes you may not get the correct match result for your video, you can try to type the id of your video in the title field to correct the match result.



## Contribute to this project
You can create an issue to report bugs. Please descript your problem, provide the movie id or search conditions that you meet the problem. And upload your log file which located in your *[Plex Media Server data directory](https://support.plex.tv/articles/202915258-where-is-the-plex-media-server-data-directory-located/)/Logs/PMS Plugin Logs/* folder and named with *com.plexapp.agents.jav.log*.

I am not going to develop new features or add other data sources. You can create a pull request to contribute to this project if you wish. 

As the development document of plex plugin has been removed, you can check out [this archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20150107154037/http://dev.plexapp.com/docs/index.html) to learn how to develop a plex plugin. Your code must comply with [RestrictedPython](https://github.com/zopefoundation/RestrictedPython).



## Changelog
### 2022-09-06
I refactored my code completely for a better maintenance and optimized the matching strategy. The naming pattern for video id had been changed, so if you add a new version to a video, this version will be regarded as a newly added video with the same name with the old one.
